# Brain_Iso-Seq
Repository of programs used for iso-seq analysis of brain samples.

The programs in this repository are the ones we used in our research (doi: ). Its purpose is to format and analyze data from a merged file that includes the results of sample chaining using TALON (https://github.com/mortazavilab/TALON) and the output file from SQANTI3 (https://github.com/ConesaLab/SQANTI3). Although there may be less versatile programs since we did not aim to provide an analysis pipeline, we will do our best to address any inquiries and are open to modification for your use.
